# PenTest-External-Network-and-Web-Site-Security-Testing

The test performed in this report were to test the external network and Web site
security of the XYZCompany. With the initial reachability test and port scan, it showed
the open port and services running that are susceptible to various exploits available
from different exploitation framework. I have used Armitage a Metasploit Graphical
user interface.

The first vulnerability in question is for windows based webserver running ISS and has
WEBDAV service running on it. The exploit “iis_webdav_upload_asp” uploads a
payload using ASP script via a WebDAV PUT request.

The second vulnerability is for older windows server and client OS. The exploit
“ms09_050_smb2_negotiate_func_index” exploits an out of bounds function in the
SMB request validation code of driver SRV2.SYS which is included in the windows OS.

The third vulnerability is for windows XP machine and exploits NetAPI32.dll. The
exploit is “ms08_067_netapi”.

For all the Vulnerability and the associated attacks, the root cause is either the
systems are not up to date in terms of OS patching, service packs, updates and are
running services that are not needed.

All the devices have default accounts enabled with week password set and no
restriction for remote access. Webserver and SQL server are outdated and running
services that are not needed.

I was able to use these vulnerabilities to perform different attacks and exploits.
